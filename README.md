# VeVeTo

Management system of the HPBV for all administrative tasks.
Programmed by DaluMa Websolutions.

## docker-compose workflow

VeVeTo uses a docker-compose workflow that sets up a LAMP network of containers for local development. 


#### Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

Open a terminal and run `docker-compose up -d --build`. Open up your browser of choice to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see the VeVeTo app running as intended. 

Containers created and their ports (if used) are as follows:

- **apache** - `80:80`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **phpMyAdmin** - `:8080`
- **MailDev** - `:8081`

## Set up local development environment

1. Clone or download this repository. Ideally somewhere where docker has write access. For example in the `/Users` directory. _(macOS)_
2. Set up docker as described above and go to your project root. _(The directory in which the `docker-compose.yml` is located)_
3. Open a browser of your choice and go to the following URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
4. The first thing we need to take care of is to install Composer. To do this, run `install composer`
5. Next, copy the `.env.example` and delete the word `.example` from the file name. So that you only have one `.env`.
6. Now we have to create a key for the `.env`. To do this, execute the following command: `php artisan key:generate`
7. Next, run `npm install` to install all packages from the `package.json`
8. The last thing we need to do is migrate the database. To do this, run the following command: `php artisan migrate â€”seed`

Maybe this process is uncompleted. If so please let me know and i will take care of it.

## Install Laravel Telescope

Laravel Telescope is an elegant debug assistant for the Laravel framework. Telescope provides insight into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache operations, scheduled tasks, variable dumps and more. Telescope makes a wonderful companion to your local Laravel development environment.

Telescope is preconfigured, if you wanne use it execute the following commands.

~~~~
1. php artisan telescope:install
2. php artisan migrate
~~~~

You can reach telesope at the following URL: [http://localhost:8080/telescope](http://localhost:8080/telescope)

## Sensible shell alias (zsh)

- **dc** - `docker-compose`
- **dce** - `docker-compose exec development bash`

To use it put the following into your `~/.zshrc`:

~~~~
alias dc="docker-compose"
alias dce="docker-compose exec development bash"
~~~~

I'm pretty sure you can use it in every other shell in a similar way.
